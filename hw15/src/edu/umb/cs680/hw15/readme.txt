The TextProcessing class represents a text processing utility that applies different text processing strategies using the Strategy Design Pattern. It takes an input text and processes it based on the provided strategy by utilizing the TextProcessor interface. This class allows for flexible and interchangeable text processing strategies, making it easy to extend and modify the processing behavior without modifying the core logic of the TextProcessing class.

Usage of Strategy Design Pattern:
The Strategy Design Pattern is utilized in the TextProcessing class to enable dynamic selection and application of different text processing strategies. Instead of implementing the processing logic directly within the TextProcessing class, it relies on the TextProcessor interface. This interface defines a contract for implementing text processing strategies. By accepting an instance of TextProcessor as a parameter in the processText method, the TextProcessing class delegates the processing task to the provided strategy without having any knowledge of the specific implementation.

This approach adheres to the principles of the Strategy Design Pattern by encapsulating individual processing algorithms into separate classes that implement the TextProcessor interface. It promotes code reuse, maintainability, and flexibility, as new strategies can be added without modifying the existing code. Clients of the TextProcessing class can easily swap and combine different strategies to achieve the desired text processing results.
